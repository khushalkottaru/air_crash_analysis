# Analysis of Historical Aviation Incidents

Before starting this analysis, my goal was to determine if air crashes have become more frequent recently, or if they are simply receiving more media coverage.
By analyzing a public dataset of aviation incidents with Python, I have reached a conclusion.

The above graph shows a relatively high number of air crashes in late 2019, right before the Covid-19 Pandemic. Once the pandemic began, air travel, and
subsequently air crashes, declined precipitously for obvious reasons. However, after the world began to recover, there was another increase in air crashes
per year, following the recovery of the air travel industry. This increase is inevitable considering the increased volume of air traffic globally, and is not
caused by a degradation in global air safety standards.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the perception of a "recent flurry of aviation incidents" is not due to declining safety standards, but rather
owes itself to more prominent and frequent reporting by the media.
